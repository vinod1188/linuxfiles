]#ps -ef -- it will show all running processes in system

]#ps -elFL -- it will display no of processes each core running

]#ps -aux | sort -nr -k3 | head  -- without using top command to know cpu utilization

			-k3 -- cpu utilization
			-k4 -- memory utilization

or

]#ps -ef | sort -nr -k3 | head

how to indentify zombie process?

]#ps - aux | grep -i "default"

or 

]#ps -ef | grep -i "Z"

]#ps -l -- it will show niece values
